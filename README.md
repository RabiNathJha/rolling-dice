# Dice Roller

The number and sides of dice to roll are indicated using the notation `nDs` where `n` is the number
of dice to roll, and `s` is the number of sides on each dice.


E.g. 4D6 means "Roll four six-sided dice". Similarly 1D20 requires the player to roll one 20-sided
dice.

For instance, 4D6 + 1D4 means "Add the value of a 4D6 roll to the value of a 1D4 roll". The
minimum and maximum values possible in this case are respectively 5, and 28.
